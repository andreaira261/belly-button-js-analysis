# Belly Button JavaScript Analysis

## Overview 
In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

We used the D3 library to read the dataset from https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json. 
For the data visualizations, we used Plotly to create a bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in each Test Subject, a bubble chart to display further details about the OTUs found, and a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual. Furthermore, we also created a Metadata table to show each Test Subject's demographic information.
